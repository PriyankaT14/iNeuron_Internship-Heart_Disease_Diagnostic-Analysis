### Project Introduction

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time, and we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyse this health and medical data for better future preparation. 

Heart Disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems, and it has become major concern in India to deal with as there is around 34.3% increase seen in number of deaths due to cardiovascular problems from 2.26 million in 1990 to 4.77 million in 2020.

Thus, it has become necessary to take precautionary measures to prevent and reduce the heart diseases among people. Therefore, to make sure that the people live healthy lives, the needed research and the prevention process of heart disease can be improved by using good data driven systems for understanding the patterns.

### Problem Statement 

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to do the research, analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation. 

### Business Objectives:

	Performing EDA through Python and find insights.
	Extract various information such as heart disease rates, Heart disease by - gender, by age.
	Compare attributes of the dataset to extract necessary information.
	Make Dashboard with extracted information from data.
	Find key metrics and factors and show relationship between attributes.

### Conclusion:
»	Almost 45.87 %  of people are suffering from Heart Disease
»	 Males and Old Age group people are more prone to Heart Disease
»	 Males in Old Age (50 – 60 Years) and Females in Old Age (55 – 65 Years) category suffer from Heart Disease more
»	 People experiencing Asymptomatic Chest Pain have a higher chance to have Heart Disease
»	 Maximum Heart Rate, Blood Pressure , Cholesterol is observed between the age 50 -60 
»	Cholesterol level of people having Heart Disease is High
»	 ST Depression Peak (Flat and Upsloping) is seen more in old Age people having Heart Disease
