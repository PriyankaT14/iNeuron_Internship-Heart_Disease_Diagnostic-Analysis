### Project Introduction

Health is real wealth in the pandemic time, and we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyse this health and medical data for better future preparation. 

Heart Disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems, and it has become major concern in India to deal with as there is around 34.3% increase seen in number of deaths due to cardiovascular problems from 2.26 million in 1990 to 4.77 million in 2020.

Thus, it has become necessary to take precautionary measures to prevent and reduce the heart diseases among people. Therefore, to make sure that the people live healthy lives, the needed research and the prevention process of heart disease can be improved by using good data driven systems for understanding the patterns.
